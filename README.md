# MPC (current version 2.2)
# Files used for a Model Predictive Control and developped on Matlab environnement. The Robotics Toolbox developped by Peter Corke, CVX (academic license) and OSQP (http://osqp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) are needed to make the scripts work.
# To lauch a simulation, execute MAIN.m
# You can change the simulation parameters in PARAMETERS.m
# Now fully able to simulate 'R' plane robot (one_link), 'RR' plane robot (two_link) and PUMA 560.
